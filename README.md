# AI-Driven-Revenue-Management-System-for-Hospitality-Finance-Optimization

## Description
This project focuses on building a next-generation AI-powered revenue management system for the hospitality industry. The system uses machine learning and big data technologies to analyze historical booking data, pricing trends, customer preferences, and external factors (like events, holidays, or weather) to recommend optimal pricing strategies and maximize revenue for hotels and resorts.

## Tech Stack
### 1. Data Ingestion and Processing:

Real-time Data: Apache Kafka for streaming real-time booking, pricing, and occupancy data.
Batch Processing: Apache Spark for processing historical booking datasets.

### 2. Data Storage:

Big Data Storage: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for scalable storage.
Cloud: AWS S3 for long-term, cost-efficient storage.
Database: Snowflake for analytical queries and structured data.
Machine Learning:

### 3. Modeling: Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) for building price optimization and demand forecasting models.
Algorithms: Time Series (ARIMA, LSTM), Classification (Random Forest), and Regression models.

### 4. APIs:
External APIs for dynamic pricing: Hotel chains, travel aggregators, weather APIs, and local event feeds.
Visualization:

### 5. BI Tools: Tableau or Power BI to display KPIs like RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), and occupancy rates.
Dashboards: Flask or Streamlit for an interactive web dashboard.

### 6. Cloud Platforms:

AWS Lambda for running serverless ML models.
Azure Data Factory for orchestrating ETL pipelines.

## Features
### 1. Dynamic Pricing Recommendations:
Automatically adjusts room rates based on demand patterns, competitor pricing, and events.
Incorporates weather and local event data to forecast spikes in bookings.

### 2. Revenue Forecasting:

Predicts revenue for the next 30, 60, or 90 days using advanced time-series models.
Simulates scenarios like price changes or seasonal promotions.

### 3. Customer Segmentation:

Clusters customers based on preferences, booking patterns, and spending behavior.
Offers personalized deals or loyalty rewards to high-value customers.

### 4. Real-Time Alerts:

Alerts for sudden changes in booking patterns (e.g., cancellations or overbooking).
Identifies opportunities for upselling or cross-selling services like room upgrades or dining packages.

### 5. Sustainability Analytics:

Tracks energy usage and operational costs, helping hospitality businesses align with ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) goals.
Implementation Plan
### 6. Data Collection:

Collect historical booking and pricing data from the hotel management system.
Integrate live streams using Apache Kafka for real-time updates.

## ETL Pipeline:

Build ETL pipelines using Apache NiFi or Airflow to clean, transform, and store data in Snowflake.

## Machine Learning Models:

Develop predictive models for dynamic pricing and demand forecasting.
Test and evaluate models with historical and real-time data.

## Dashboard Development:

Use Streamlit or Flask to create a user-friendly interface for management to access reports and recommendations.

## Deployment:

Deploy the solution on AWS or Azure for scalability.
Use Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.

## Outcome
- Boost revenue by optimizing room rates dynamically.
- Improve operational efficiency through real-time analytics.
- Enhance customer satisfaction with personalized experiences.
- Achieve better alignment with sustainability goals.
